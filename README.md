## Why We Built This Solution: 
We built this solution to address common challenges people face with large, complex documents 📑. Traditional search tools can be limiting and are often inaccessible for individuals with disabilities . By integrating RAG and voice technology 🤖, we aimed to create an app that lets users interact with documents naturally, using conversation 💬.

### 🎯 Target Users: 
- **Individuals with Visual Impairments or Learning Disabilities** : Benefit from having documents read aloud and interacting using voice commands, promoting accessibility.
- **Business Professionals** 📊: Work with lengthy contracts, proposals, or reports and require a fast, accessible way to review documents.
- **Multitaskers** 💼: Engage with documents hands-free, listening to summaries or searching documents while focusing on other tasks.
- **Students and Researchers** 🧑‍🎓: Need to extract and interact with large volumes of information from academic PDFs, reports, or textbooks quickly.
