# Query PDF (Speak, Search and Summarize)

## Solution Overview:
**Query PDF** is a voice-powered AI RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application designed to simplify working with PDFs. Users upload documents and interact via voice commands, receiving accurate summaries and real-time responses. 

## Why We Built This Solution:
We built this to address challenges people face with large, complex documents. Traditional search tools are limiting, especially for individuals with disabilities. By combining RAG and voice technology, we created a natural, conversational way to interact with documents.

### Target Users:
- **Individuals with Visual Impairments or Learning Disabilities**: Benefit from having documents read aloud and voice-command interaction.
- **Business Professionals**: Working with lengthy contracts, proposals, or reports who need a fast, accessible review process.
- **Multitaskers**: Engage with documents hands-free, allowing focus on other tasks while receiving summaries.
- **Students and Researchers**: Need to quickly extract and interact with academic PDFs, reports, or textbooks.

## How RAG Helped:
RAG ensures the app delivers accurate, relevant information by retrieving specific content from PDFs. It minimizes errors, making the app a reliable tool for users needing precise, document-based answers.

## Innovation:
This app uniquely combines **voice interaction** with **RAG technology** to offer a seamless, hands-free way to navigate PDFs. Itâ€™s particularly useful for those with visual impairments or users who prefer voice-driven exploration over reading.

## Impact:
Query PDF transforms how people interact with digital documents. Voice-driven summaries and search provide students, professionals, and users with accessibility needs easy access to key information without sifting through lengthy PDFs manually.
